# eHacks2017
Project for 2017 eHacks

## General Guide:

## Goals:

~Win prize for Data Vizualization~

-Win prize for Data Use

## Finding rude people on twitter. 

Search tweets looking for rude keywords or neuralnet to analyze 

If you find a user that is a "bully" you could check their tweets with other users deemed to be "bullies" and possibly find common words to help find more people. (this might be handeled by the neuralnet)


## Stuff we need done:
 - Remove all non A-Z characters from tweets before we store them in text file
Â - possibly put username in and check some number of tweets. Average the prob of pos to see how harrass-y person is

 - emoji support
