# MeanTweetReader - eHacks2017
Project for 2017 eHacks

## General Guide:
python gui.py

## Goals:

 - Do something with Data Vizualization
 - Do something with Big Data

## Finding rude people on twitter. 

Search tweets looking for rude keywords or neuralnet to analyze 

If you find a user that is a "bully" you could check their tweets with other users deemed to be "bullies" and possibly find common words to help find more people. (this might be handeled by the neuralnet)
